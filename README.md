Server code can be anywhere.

Client code has to be accessable from your port (wherever your port forwarded ip goes to in your computer)


--Web Accessable Stuff (to download)--

WampServer
Visual C++
No-IP DUC
*Then you have to port forward your ip through your router*




--TypeScript/Socket.io/Express stuff (to download)--

npm
node.js (maybe idk)

    -Commands to run in cmd in your directory for your server
    
      npm init
      npm i express @types/express
      npm i socket.io @types/socket.io
      npm i nodemon
    
    
    -Commands to run in cmd in your client directory

Everything else is in the code or covered in the video
